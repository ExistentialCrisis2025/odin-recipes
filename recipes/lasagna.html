    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lasagna is a popular pasta dish of Italian origin, characterized by its layered construction. It typically consists of flat, wide pasta sheets (lasagna) layered with a rich meat sauce (often ragù Bolognese), béchamel sauce (a white sauce made with butter and flour), and cheeses like ricotta and mozzarella. The dish is then baked until golden and bubbly, allowing the flavors to meld and the cheeses to melt. </p>

    <p>While variations exist, including vegetarian and seafood-based options, the traditional lasagna features a combination of savory and creamy elements. The hearty meat sauce and flavorful béchamel provide a rich foundation, while the layered cheeses offer a delightful texture and taste experience. Lasagna is a comforting and satisfying dish, often enjoyed as a main course or family meal. </p>
